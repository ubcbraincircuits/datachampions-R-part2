When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("coin")
library(coin)
ants <- read.csv("C:/Users/sarah/OneDrive/Desktop/ants.csv")
ants$place <- factor(ants$place)
print(ants)
oneway_test(colonies~place,data=ants)
```
