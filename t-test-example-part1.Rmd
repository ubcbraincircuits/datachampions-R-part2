# Question 5.
Perform a two sample t-test on our sample_1 and sample_2 vectors. Use the help() function to figure out how we can use the t.test function to do a two sample t-test. Please specify that the variances are equal for our 2 samples in this test. 

```{r}
# In order to make sure we are not breaking the assumptions of the t-test, I am going to quickly make a couple of samples for us. 
sample_1 = rnorm(25, mean = 10, sd = 2.5)
sample_2 = rnorm(50, mean = 13, sd = 2.5)

t.test(sample_1, sample_2, var.equal = TRUE)

```
